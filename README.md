This project is a chatbot developed using LLM (Large Language Models) capable of answering questions about YouTube videos based on their transcriptions. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze user queries and retrieve relevant information from the video transcriptions.

## Features

- **Video Analysis**: The chatbot can respond to questions about YouTube videos using the information present in their transcriptions.
- **Spanish Interaction**: The chatbot is designed to respond in Spanish, facilitating communication for Spanish-speaking users.
- **Utilization of LLM Models**: The langchain_community.llms library is used to leverage LLM models in generating responses.
